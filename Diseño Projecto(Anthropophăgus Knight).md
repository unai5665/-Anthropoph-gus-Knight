| 2 Pitch |  | In this app, users will:  Enjoy a single-player demo of metroidvania genre. In it, you will advance through a dungeon full of dangers and ruthless enemies. To survive, you will need to dodge their attacks with precision and use your main weapon to finish them off. As you go deeper into the depths of the dungeon, the enemies will get more powerful and ruthless. To confront them, you'll have to make a difficult decision: strip yourself of your principles and consume your enemies, absorbing their strength to make it your own. You will discover the story of our protagonist, his motivations and the shadows of his past. Each confrontation will reveal fragments of his inner struggle, leading you to question his humanity. After a long and arduous path full of challenges, you will reach your final challenge: to confront the master and lord of the dungeon. The final battle will not only decide your fate, but also that of Heraklon. Are you willing to sacrifice your essence to obtain the necessary power? Or will you resist the temptation, facing your enemy with your pure strength? The choice is yours.   |  |
